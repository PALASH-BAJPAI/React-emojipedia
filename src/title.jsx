      is composed of an "e" for image and "moji" for character. Inspired by the
      manga world, software engineer Shigetaka Kurita developed 176 emojis in
      the 1990s. He was working on a pager service for a Japanese mobile
      provider and thereby wanted to boost its marketing among young people.
      Emojis are images or pictographs. Facial expressions and gestures are
      shown in the form of faces and people. Objects, food, activities, animals,
      plants, places and other associations can also be displayed. This allows
      for more expressive communication. Emoticons are now automatically
      converted into emojis in word processing programs or online services. To
      display emojis, the Unicode is converted into a graphic. Emojis have been
      available on our mobile phones since 2010.
